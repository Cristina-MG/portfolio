<h4> Computer vision project for the detection of the face of a cartoon character.</h4>

This computer vision project aims to detect the face of Bart Simpson, one of the best known characters from the cartoon series 'The Simpson'. 

The main benefit that can be obtained from the use of computer vision is the high precision that this technology can have for the detection of objects that can replace human vision. 

The following video shows how the face of this character is detected.
