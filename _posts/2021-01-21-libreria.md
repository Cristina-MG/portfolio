<h4> Python library generation group project with useful functions for Data Science.</h4>

I am currently working with my colleagues in the Pythoneer library at PyPI. The idea of ​​creating this library has arisen from the need to automate processes using functions to facilitate the work of Data Analysts and Data Scientists.

This library contains data cleaning, visualization and Machine Learning functions.

You can download this library by applying `pip install pythoneer`.

All the project code can be viewed by accessing this [repository](https://github.com/Cristina-MG/lib_pythoneers).
