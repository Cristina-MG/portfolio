# Customer Loyalty Monitoring in Banking Sector using R and Shiny

In this project, I have developed an **application** using **R** and **Shiny** to monitor **customer loyalty** in the **banking sector**. The application includes several **tabs** offering different perspectives and analyses on the state of customer loyalty.

## Overview

The **"Overview"** tab features a **dashboard** displaying various **charts**. These charts provide detailed insights into customer loyalty status based on different factors such as **country**, **age**, and **economic solvency**.

## Customer Segment Analysis

The next tab focuses on monitoring different **customer segments** identified using a **K-means model**. Customers are divided into four groups: **Celestial Customer**, **Emerald Customer**, **Purple Customer**, and **Golden Customer**. The application details the main characteristics of each segment and includes values and charts that reveal the loyalty status of these segments separately.

## Loyalty Prediction

In the **"Prediction"** tab, a **decision tree** is used to create a **predictive model**. This model allows input of various variables and provides a **probability** of whether a customer will continue using the company's services or not.

## Dataset Information

Finally, the **"Information"** tab provides detailed information about the **dataset** used for this project. Here, users can explore the data and gain a better understanding of the foundation upon which the application is built.
