<h2 align = "left"> My name is Cristina Martínez García and I have a degree in Chemical Engineering from the Higher School of Industrial Engineers of the Polytechnic University of Madrid. I have expanded my knowledge to become a Data Scientist and adapt to the new demands of Industry 4.0 by taking a Data course Scientist at The Bridge.
I know the main data analysis and Machine Learning tools, and I put all my effort and motivation to improve and learn every day.

On this page, you can find all the projects I have worked on and are currently working on.

The projects are written in the Python programming language (Jupyter Notebook | PyCharm | Google Colab).

Feel free to browse this page and take a look at the projects that appeal to you the most.</h2>
